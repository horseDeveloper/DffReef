**Readex Pro** is the world-script expansion of Lexend. It's the same as Lexend, with the addition of more scripts (at this moment: Arabic) - [GitHub page](https://github.com/ThomasJockin/readexpro)

## dff Font Families

3 glyphs from the alternative set have been locked in as default. This means you don't need software that supports special font features to access the alternative glyphs, you just need to download and install your preferred font.

The three modifications:

# Disclaimer
This project exists only to improve compatibility and ease of use for software that doesn't support easily switching to alternative glyphs. dffLentic & dffReef are completely based on [Lexend](https://www.lexend.com/) and [Readex Pro](https://github.com/ThomasJockin/readexpro) but are in no way related to them. dffLentic & dffReef have different names as per [OFL Guidelines](https://openfontlicense.org/how-to-modify-ofl-fonts/) but I have done my best to maintain the references to the original products.
