Lexend and ReadexPro are both unconventional [sans-serif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif) typefaces as they make an exception for the uppercase 'I', giving it a [serif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif).

## dff Font Families
### dffLentic & dffReef > Font info
[dff**Le**ntic](https://github.com/horseDeveloper/dffLentic) is a fork of **Le**xend. [dff**Re**ef](https://github.com/horseDeveloper/dffReef) is a fork of **Re**adexPro. <br>
Both forks are based on the originals, but 3 glyphs from the alternative set have been locked in as default. 

The three modifications:

## Alternatively, build your own fonts
This project is a simple modification of the original work done through editing precompiled fonts. Original source files are untouched. Editing source files is outside the scope of this project.

## Alternatively, edit on top of the original precompiled files
### With my python tools to automate the process
Requirements: Tools used for the manual process are still required.
(ðŸ“¥ py line editor add link here)
(ðŸ“¥ py compare)

### Manually

# Disclaimer
This project exists only to improve compatibility and ease of use for software that doesn't support easily switching to alternative glyphs. dffLentic & dffReef are completely based on [Lexend](https://www.lexend.com/) and [Readex Pro](https://github.com/ThomasJockin/readexpro) but are in no way related to them. dffLentic & dffReef have different names as per [OFL Guidelines](https://openfontlicense.org/how-to-modify-ofl-fonts/) but I have done my best to maintain the references to the original products.
