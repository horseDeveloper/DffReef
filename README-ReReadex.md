Lexend and ReadexPro are both unconventional [sans-serif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif) typefaces as they make an exception for the uppercase 'I', giving it a [serif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif).

# Disclaimer
This project exists only to improve compatibility and ease of use for software that doesn't support easily switching to alternative glyphs. dffLentic & dffReef are completely based on [Lexend](https://www.lexend.com/) and [Readex Pro](https://github.com/ThomasJockin/readexpro) but are in no way related to them. dffLentic & dffReef have different names as per [OFL Guidelines](https://openfontlicense.org/how-to-modify-ofl-fonts/) but I have done my best to maintain the references to the original products.
