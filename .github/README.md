## Lexend & Readex Font Families

## Alternatively, build your own fonts
This project is a simple modification of the original work done through editing precompiled fonts. Original source files are untouched. Editing source files is outside the scope of this project.

## Alternatively, edit on top of the original precompiled files
### With my python tools to automate the process
Requirements: Tools used for the manual process are still required.
[ðŸ“¥ py-line-editor]
[ðŸ“¥ py-compare2lexend]

### Manually

# Disclaimer
This project exists only to improve compatibility and ease of use for software that doesn't support easily switching to alternative glyphs. dffLentic & dffReef are completely based on [Lexend](https://www.lexend.com/) and [Readex Pro](https://github.com/ThomasJockin/readexpro) but are in no way related to them. dffLentic & dffReef have different names as per [OFL Guidelines](https://openfontlicense.org/how-to-modify-ofl-fonts/) but I have done my best to maintain the references to the original products.
